# PowerSensor-Atmega1608

This project impelements a remote sensor node that adheres to the protocol as 
defined in the Gateway project. The node will attach to a gateway and signal 
its readiness to send data. The gateway will acknowledge the readiness with 
either a Data-Request or a Node-Introduction-Request.

This project was created using a Test Driven Design approach
